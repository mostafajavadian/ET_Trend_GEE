# ET_Trend_GEE
In this study which has entirely done by Google Earth Engine, we developed a user-friendly evapotranspiration Trend monitoring (ETM) application that enables users to produce annual AET map for any user-selected year. Furthermore, users can obtain annual trends for Actual ET, Potential ET, Precipitation, and GPP trends, as well as monthly PP trend for any user-selected grid. Furthermore, the app can be used to produce animations (e.g., eight-day changes of Actual ET in Australia in 2018 are animated in the bottom left of the app).

The application is available in Google Earth Engine by link below:
